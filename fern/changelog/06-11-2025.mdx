# v7.0.0

## Flag cleanup reminders and automation

To help you stay on top of technical debt, we've introduced automated reminders for flag cleanup.

When a feature flag reaches its intended cleanup date and we no longer detect metrics, we’ll remind you to change its lifecycle status to **Cleanup**. This highlights the flag in the UI, making it clear which flags are ready to be removed.

On the flag's page, you will see a reminder to remove the flag from your codebase and archive it in Unleash.

## External links on feature flags

You can now add external links to your feature flags, allowing you to connect directly to related resources like key metrics, analytics, or issue trackers. Add a link on the **Overview** page of any feature flag.

In addition, you can define link templates at the project level in **Settings > Project settings > Enterprise settings > Project link templates**.

These templates automatically populate links for all new feature flags within that project. For example, you can create templates to find all usages of a feature flag in your repository or automatically link to a Jira issue when a flag is created from Jira

## Colors on tags

To help you visually differentiate and organize your feature flags, you can now add colors to [tags](/concepts/feature-toggles#tags). When you create or edit a tag in **Configure > Tag types**, you can assign a specific color. This makes it easier to quickly identify and manage flags, especially in projects with many tags.

## Improved flag search and Admin UI menu

We've renamed **Search** to **Flags overview**, to create a centralized place to monitor the status and lifecycle of all your feature flags and releases. This is particularly useful for coordinating flags across multiple teams.

With **Flags overview**, you can get a clear picture of where each flag is in its lifecycle and its current status—replacing the need for manual tracking or spreadsheets.

We've also redesigned the **Configure** menu and removed redundant items such as **Recent projects** and **Recent flags**, which are now accessible from the main **Dashboard**.

## Simplified activation strategies and constraints

We simplified the process of adding or editing [activation strategies](/concepts/activation-strategies) and constraints. Use **Add strategy** to add the default activation strategy to a flag; use **More strategies** to select a different strategy type or get an overview of all available release templates.

## Removed deprecated endpoints and schema properties

As part of our commitment to maintaining a clean and robust codebase, several deprecated API endpoints and schema properties have been removed in Unleash v7. Refer to our [Migration guide](/deploy/upgrading-unleash) for a detailed list of API changes and additional help with upgrading to Unleash 7.
