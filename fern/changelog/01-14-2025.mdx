# v6.4.0

## Simplified projects
We've simplified the experience of managing your projects in Unleash. On the project overview page, you can now use filters to access [archived](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/feature-toggles#view-archived-flags) or [stale](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/feature-toggles#view-archived-flags) flags.

Additional enhancements, such as tooltips and accessibility improvements, provide a more consistent and focused experience.

## Project status dashboard

We've introduced a new [Project status dashboard](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/technical-debt#project-status) to help you monitor your projects more effectively.
The dashboard provides an overview of:

- Project health
- Project resources: members, API keys, and segments
- Project activity
- Flag lifecycle data

## Deprecated Admin tokens
We've deprecated Admin tokens to encourage using more secure and granular access to resources. You can use [personal access tokens](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys#personal-access-tokens) or [service accounts](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/service-accounts) instead.

## Restrictions on account sharing
We've implemented security measures to detect shared accounts as they impede the ability to trace and audit changes. You can find further recommendations and best practices on our [blog](https://www.getunleash.io/blog/stop-sharing-accounts).
