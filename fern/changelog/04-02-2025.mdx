# v6.7.0

## Improved user roles and permissions overview

We've added a new **Access overview** page for each user, making it easier for administrators to see exactly what a user can do in Unleash and which roles grant those permissions. You can explore permissions at the root level or for specific environments and projects.
To view a user's permissions, go to **Admin settings > Users**. Select a user and click **Access overview**.

## IP addresses in Event Log

The [Event Log](/concepts/events#event-log) now records the IP address of the user who performed each action. This feature requires an Unleash Enterprise plan.

## Projects no longer require an Owner

We removed the requirement for projects to have an [Owner](/concepts/rbac#predefined-roles). This gives you full flexibility when it comes to customizing the project-level roles. Projects without an Owner are shown as owned by System.

## New root-level permissions for authentication and instance maintenance

We've introduced five new [root-level permissions](/concepts/rbac#root-permissions) to give more granular control over features that were previously restricted to the Admin role. These permissions cover authentication settings such as single sign-on, instance maintenance tasks like updating banners and toggling maintenance mode, managing CORS settings, and viewing access logs and login history.
