## Observability metrics for Edge
We’ve introduced a [new dashboard](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/network-view#connected-edges) that provides detailed observability metrics for Unleash Edge, helping teams efficiently manage all their connected Edge instances. 
The dashboard offers a high-level view of all Edge instances, with deeper insights into instance ID, region, CPU and memory usage, and upstream/downstream latency. This data helps you ensure that all instances are operational and quickly identify potential issues.
You can access these metrics in **Network > Connected Edges** for Edge instances on version 19.7.0 or later.


## Data usage date range selector

The Data Usage dashboard now provides an aggregated view of your requests to Unleash over the last 3, 6, or 12 months—making it simple to track and assess your data usage over time. You can also compare your usage in previous months with the current month. Access the dashboard in **Network > Data Usage**.


## Event Timeline now lives in Dashboard

We have moved **Event Timeline** to the top of **Dashboard** for a more seamless experience and easier access.
