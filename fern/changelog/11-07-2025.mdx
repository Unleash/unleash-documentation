# v7.3.0

## Improved experience for adding strategies to flags

We redesigned how you add [activation strategies](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/activation-strategies) to flags. The new flow makes it easier to access standard strategies and reusable [release templates](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/release-templates).
When you configure a flag in an environment, click Add strategy and choose one of the following options:
- The [project's default strategy](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/activation-strategies#default-strategy)
- A [standard strategy](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/activation-strategies#standard-strategies), such as gradual rollout or on/off
- An [advanced strategy](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/activation-strategies#advanced-strategies), such as IP or host targeting
- A[ release template](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/release-templates)
- A [custom activation strategy](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/custom-activation-strategies) defined in your instance

You'll also see a suggested strategy in any environment without an active configuration, so you can preview, edit, or apply your default strategy in a single click.

### New lifecycle analytics
We've added two new widgets to the [Analytics](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/insights) dashboard: **New flags in production** and **Flags archived vs flags created**.

**New flags in production** shows how many flags reached production each week for your selected time period. It gives you a quick view of your team’s delivery pace and how feature output changes over time.

**Flags archived vs. created track**s how many flags you archive each week compared to how many you create, alongside your average cleanup ratio. If you consistently create more flags than you archive, that’s a sign that technical debt may be increasing. Over time, aim for a 1:1 ratio (or 100%) of archived to created flags to keep your codebase healthy.

### Aligned quick filters in Project Overview

We aligned quick filters in **Project Overview** to provide a more consistent experience with feature flags lists. You can now use the same filters available on **Flags Overview** to narrow down flags by [lifecycle stage](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/feature-toggles#lifecycle-stages), such as _Develop_, _Production_, or _Clean-up_.
