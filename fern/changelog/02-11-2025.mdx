# v6.5.0

## Renamed feature flag lifecycle stages

We’ve updated the names of the [feature flag lifecycle](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/feature-toggles#feature-flag-lifecycle) stages to better mirror a typical software development process and help you improve your release efficiency and workflows.

The changes include updates to the names, icons, and colors for the different stages.


## Updated license policy for self-hosted Enterprise

Since Unleash v6.0, we’ve had soft limits in place warning self-hosted Enterprise instances operating without a [valid license](https://docs.getunleash.io/using-unleash/deploy/license-keys) or exceeding their seat count.
With Unleash v6.7, we have introduced the following restrictions:

### Mandatory license for enterprise self-hosted plan

If you don't have a valid license, your Unleash instance enters read-only mode, and the only available action is to install a valid license.

### License expiration
When your license expires, your Unleash instance enters read-only mode. The only available action is to install a new, valid license. Connected applications continue to operate and receive current feature flags, but users cannot make any changes to Unleash.

### Seat count
If you reach the maximum number of seats in your license, you cannot add new users until you remove existing users to stay within your limit.
The Unleash Admin UI displays warning banners for customers approaching or exceeding the terms of their license.
