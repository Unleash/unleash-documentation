# v7.4.0

## Enterprise Edge observability

We extended the observability dashboard for [Unleash Enterprise Edge](/unleash-edge). The dashboard provides visibility into the health and performance of your hosted or self-hosted Enterprise Edge nodes directly within the Unleash Admin UI.

Key metrics include:
- **Instance details**: Region, instance ID, upstream server, and hosting type.
- **Health resources**: Current connection status, running version, and real-time CPU and memory usage.
- **Traffic and performance**: Active streaming clients and granular latency breakdowns for upstream syncs (features, metrics) and downstream evaluations.

### Announcement: Unleash Edge OSS enters long-term maintenance

We are sunsetting the Open Source Software (OSS) version of Unleash Edge to focus on Enterprise Edge capabilities. The lifecycle for the OSS version is as follows:
- **Long-term support**: starts December 12, 2025
- **End-of-life**: December 31, 2026

We recommend that all OSS users of Edge migrate to [Enterprise Edge](/unleash-edge#how-to-get-enterprise-edge) to ensure continued support and access to security updates.

### Global change request overview

We added a global overview for [change requests](/concepts/change-requests). The table allows you to view all your open and closed change requests in a single location.
You can filter the table to show:
- **Created by me**: Change requests created by you.
- **Approval requested**: Change requests requesting your approval.
