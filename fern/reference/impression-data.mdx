title: "Impression data"
---

<Note>
  **Version**: `4.7+`. Requires [SDK compatibility](/reference/sdks#feature-compatibility-in-backend-sdks).
</Note>

Unleash can provide you with **impression data** about the flags in your application. Impression data contains information about a specific feature flag activation check: The client SDK will emit an **impression event** when it calls `isEnabled` or `getVariant`. Some front-end SDKs emit impression events only when a flag is enabled.

<Warning>
  Older versions of the front-end SDKs and other SDKs that connect the [Unleash proxy](/reference/unleash-proxy) or the [Unleash front-end API](/reference/front-end-api) would **not** emit impression events when a flag is disabled.

  This is because impression data is a **per-flag** setting and the Proxy and front-end API only transmit information about flags that are enabled. As such, the SDK will never know that it should emit an impression event if a flag is disabled.

  Some of the front-end SDKs now include a include a configuration property that lets you turn on impression data for all flags regardless of whether they're enabled or not.
</Warning>

Impression data was designed to make it easier for you to **collect analytics data**, **perform A/B tests**, and **enrich experiments** in your applications. It contains information about the feature flag and the related [Unleash Context](/reference/unleash-context).

Impression data is **opt-in on a per-flag basis**. Unleash will not emit impression events for flags not marked as such. Once you've turned impression data on for a flag, you can start listening for impression events in your client SDK.

## Impression event data[​](#impression-event-data "Direct link to Impression event data")

There's two types of impression events you can listen for:

* [`isEnabled` events](#example-isenabled)
* [`getVariant` events](#example-getvariant)

The `getVariant` event contains all the information found in an `isEnabled` event in addition to extra data that's only relevant to `getVariant` calls.

This table describes all the properties on the impression events:

| Property name | Description                                                                    | Event type               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `eventType`   | The type of the event: `isEnabled` or `getVariant`                             | All                      |
| `eventId`     | A globally unique id (GUID) assigned to this event.                            | All                      |
| `context`     | A representation of the current [Unleash Context](/reference/unleash-context). | All                      |
| `enabled`     | Whether the flag was enabled or not at when the client made the request.       | All                      |
| `featureName` | The name of the feature flag.                                                  | All                      |
| `variant`     | The name of the active variant                                                 | `getVariant` events only |

### Example `isEnabled` event[​](#example-isenabled "Direct link to example-isenabled")

```
{  eventType: 'isEnabled',  eventId: '84b41a43-5ba0-47d8-b21f-a60a319607b0',  context: {    sessionId: 54085233,    appName: 'my-webapp',    environment: 'default'  },  enabled: true,  featureName: 'my-feature-flag',}
```

### Example `getVariant` event[​](#example-getvariant "Direct link to example-getvariant")

```
{  eventType: 'getVariant',  eventId: '84b41a43-5ba0-47d8-b21f-a60a319607b0',  context: {    sessionId: 54085233,    appName: 'my-webapp',    environment: 'default'  },  enabled: true,  featureName: 'my-feature-flag',  variant: 'variantA'}
```

## Enabling impression data[​](#enabling-impression-data "Direct link to Enabling impression data")

Impression data is strictly an **opt-in** feature and must be enabled on a **per-flag basis**. You can enable and disable it both when you create a flag and when you edit a flag.

You can enable impression data via the impression data flag in the admin UI's flag creation form. You can also go via the [the API, using the `impressionData` option](/reference/api/legacy/unleash/admin/features-v2#create-toggle). For more detailed instructions, see [the section on enabling impression data in the how-to guide for capturing impression data](/feature-flag-tutorials/use-cases/how-to-capture-impression-data).

![A feature flag creation form. At the end of the form is a heading that says \&quot;Impression data\&quot;, a short paragraph that describes the feature, and a flag to opt in or out of it.](../images/reference/assets/images/create_feat_impression-d4513856d3c9992ba05d9925d46a804e.png)

## Example setup[​](#example-setup "Direct link to Example setup")

The exact setup will vary depending on your [client SDK](/reference/sdks). The below example configures the [Unleash Proxy client](/reference/sdks/javascript-browser) to listen for impression events and log them to the console. If "my-feature-flag" is configured to emit impression data, then it will trigger an impression event as soon as Unleash is ready.

```
const unleash = new UnleashClient({  url: 'https://eu.unleash-hosted.com/hosted/proxy',  clientKey: 'your-proxy-key',  appName: 'my-webapp',});unleash.start();unleash.on('ready', () => {  unleash.isEnabled('my-feature-flag');});unleash.on('impression', (event) => {  // Capture the event here and pass it to internal data lake or analytics provider  console.log(event);});
```
