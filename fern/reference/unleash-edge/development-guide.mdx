### Tools[​](#tools "Direct link to Tools")

* Install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
* Copy the pre-commit hook in the hooks folder to .git/hooks/pre-commit
* Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker), making sure your user has access to use it.

```
cp hooks/* .git/hooks/
```

* For test coverage: `cargo install cargo-tarpaulin`
* For smart release: `cargo install cargo-smart-release`
* For workspaces: `cargo install cargo-workspaces`

### Practices[​](#practices "Direct link to Practices")

* We use rustfmt (triggered from cargo fmt) to format our source code
* We try to keep to [conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) - This simplifies creating and keeping a changelog up to date as well as helping to decide which version to bump when releasing a new version
* We will adhere to [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
* We use Clippy to ensure that our code follows a consistent format, you can run Clippy using `cargo clippy --fix` once it's installed
* We try to stick to one feature per crate. The workspace is configured to automatically pick up any new crates under crates/\*
  * If this causes circular dependencies, have a chat with @chriswk or @sighphyre before implementing your new feature.

### Development Toolchain Installation[​](#development-toolchain-installation "Direct link to Development Toolchain Installation")

For a quicker build/test loop, we provide a `just` setup which takes around a tenth of the time of `cargo build`. You'll need to install a few tools for this to work correctly.

#### Just[​](#just "Direct link to Just")

Just can be installed with cargo:

```
cargo install just
```

#### Clang + LLD[​](#clang--lld "Direct link to Clang + LLD")

Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based):

```
sudo apt install clang lld
```

MacOS

```
xcode-select --install
```

Windows Install the "Desktop Development with C++" workload via the Visual Studio Installer. This typically includes clang and lld.

#### Cranelift[​](#cranelift "Direct link to Cranelift")

Ensure you're using a nightly Rust toolchain

```
rustup default nightly
```

Install cranelift with rustup:

```
rustup component add rustc-codegen-cranelift-preview --toolchain nightly
```

#### Using The Development Build[​](#using-the-development-build "Direct link to Using The Development Build")

The just file provides fast build and test commands using the Cranelift backend and LLD linker. These steps skip integration tests and are typically \~10x faster than a full cargo build.

```
just buildjust test
```

If you're unable to use LLD (due to system configuration, linker errors, or platform limitations), use the system linker instead:

```
just sysbuildjust systest
```

### Common commands[​](#common-commands "Direct link to Common commands")

* `cargo add ...` - Add a dependency to the Cargo.toml file
* `cargo remove ...` - Remove a dependency from the Cargo.toml file
* `cargo check` - Checks a local package and all of its dependencies for errors
* `cargo clippy` - Run Clippy to get code warnings
* `cargo fmt` - Format the code using rustfmt
* `cargo test` - Run the tests
* `cargo build` - Build a debug build. The executable will be available in ./target/debug/unleash-edge once successful
* `cargo build --release` - Build a release build. The executable will be available in ./target/release/unleash-edge once successful. - If you want to run loadtesting, you should really build in release mode. 10-20x faster than the debug build
* `cargo run -- edge --markdown-help -u http://localhost:4242 > CLI.md` - Update the CLI.md file.
* `cargo run -- edge -h` - Start here to run edge mode locally.
* `cargo run -- offline -h` - Start here to run offline mode locally.

### Testing[​](#testing "Direct link to Testing")

By default `cargo test` will run all the tests. If you want to exclude the expensive integration tests you can instead run `cargo test --bin unleash-edge`.

### Docker requirement[​](#docker-requirement "Direct link to Docker requirement")

In order for all tests to successfully build, you'll need Docker installed. We use [testcontainers](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-rs) to spin up a redis container to test our redis feature. Testcontainers require docker to run
