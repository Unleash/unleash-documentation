The easiest way to get started with Unleash is through a cloud-hosted free trial. This gives you a ready-to-use instance, so you can explore all Unleash features without any local setup.

In this guide, you'll:

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a flag">
    Create your first feature flag using the Unleash Admin UI.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect an SDK">

If you prefer to manage your own infrastructure, see the [self-hosted setup guide](/using-unleash/deploy/getting-started). To use the open-source version, see the instructions in the [Unleash GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash?tab=readme-ov-file#get-started-with-unleash).

## Sign up for an Unleash Enterprise Cloud trial[​](#sign-up-for-an-unleash-enterprise-cloud-trial "Direct link to Sign up for an Unleash Enterprise Cloud trial")

Start by signing up for a [free 14-day trial](https://www.getunleash.io/plans/enterprise-payg) of Unleash Enterprise Cloud.

<Button intent="primary">Start free trial</Button>

After you submit the form, you will receive a confirmation email. Follow the link in the email to set your password and log in to your Unleash instance.

## Create your first feature flag[​](#create-your-first-feature-flag "Direct link to Create your first feature flag")

Once you've logged in, it's time to create your first <Tooltip tip="Feature flags let you turn functionality on or off without redeploying code.">feature flag</Tooltip>:

1. In the Unleash Admin UI, open the **Default** project.
2. Click **New feature flag**.
3. Enter a name, and click **Create feature flag**.

For more details on creating feature flags, see [How to create a feature flag](/how-to-create-feature-flag).

## Connect your application to Unleash[​](#connect-your-application-to-unleash "Direct link to Connect your application to Unleash")

Next, use one of the client or backend [SDKs](/reference/sdks) to connect Unleash with your application.

</Accordion>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Connect a frontend SDK">
    1. **Create an API token**

   In the Unleash Admin UI, create a [frontend API token](/reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys#frontend-tokens) in **Admin settings > Access control > API access**.

2. **Get your Unleash API URL**

   Find the base URL of your Unleash Cloud instance (for example, `https://us.app.unleash-hosted.com/some-instance-id`). Your frontend API URL is this base URL with `/api/frontend` appended to it.

3. **Initialize the SDK**

   In your application code, initialize the SDK using your API URL and token.

The following example shows how to use the [JavaScript SDK](/reference/sdks/javascript-browser) to connect to your Unleash instance:

```javascript title="JavaScript SDK"
import { UnleashClient } from "unleash-proxy-client";

const unleash = new UnleashClient({
    url: "https://<YOUR_UNLEASH_INSTANCE>/api/frontend",
    clientKey: "<YOUR_TOKEN>",
    appName: "<YOUR_APP_NAME>",
});

unleash.on("synchronized", () => {
    // Unleash is ready to serve updated feature flags.

    // Check a feature flag
    if (unleash.isEnabled("some-flag")) {
        // do cool new things when the flag is enabled
    }
});

```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Connect a backend SDK">
    1. **Create an API token**

   In the Unleash Admin UI, create a [backend token](/reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys#backend-tokens) in **Admin settings > Access control > API access**.

2. **Get your Unleash API URL**

   Find the base URL of your Unleash Cloud instance (for example, `https://us.app.unleash-hosted.com/some-instance-id`). Your API URL is this base URL with `/api` appended to it.

3. **Initialize the SDK**

   In your application code, initialize the SDK using your API URL and token.

The following example shows how to use the [Node.js SDK](/reference/sdks/node) to connect to your Unleash instance:

```javascript title="NodeJS SDK"
const { initialize } = require("unleash-client");

const unleash = initialize({
    url: "https://<YOUR_UNLEASH_INSTANCE>/api",
    appName: "<YOUR_APP_NAME>",
    customHeaders: {
        Authorization: "<YOUR_TOKEN>",
    },
});

unleash.on("synchronized", () => {
    // Unleash is ready to serve updated feature flags.

    if (unleash.isEnabled("some-flag")) {
        // do cool new things when the flag is enabled
    }
});
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## FAQs


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How can we synchronize flag configurations between different environments?">
    For your day-to-day workflow, you typically configure the flag's activation strategies in each of the target environments manually. 
    If you want to bootstrap a whole new environment, you can clone an existing environment and tweak the flag configurations as needed. 
    For full automation, you can use the Unleash API to build scripts that read the configuration from a source environment and apply it to a target.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I restrict a user's access to only one environment within a project?">
    Yes. This is a core use case for custom project roles. 
    You can create a new role (for example, "QA Engineer") and grant it permissions, such as UPDATE_FEATURE_STRATEGY, only for the testing environment. 
    For all other environments like development and production, you would grant no permissions or read-only permissions. 
    This ensures the user can only make changes in their designated environment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many environments should we have?">
    It depends on your release process. A typical setup for a large organization is three to five environments:
    
    - development: For local developer machines and CI builds.  
    - test or QA: A shared, stable environment for dedicated testing by the QA team.  
    - staging or pre-prod: A production-like environment for final validation, performance testing, and release rehearsals.  
    - production: The live environment for your end users.  

    Some organizations add more specialized environments, such as one for demo purposes or a hotfix environment for emergency patches.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is Unleash's environment model different from other tools like LaunchDarkly?">
    Unleash uses a unified flag model where a single flag is a persistent entity across all environments, with only its configuration (strategies, variants) changing per environment. 
    This provides a holistic, end-to-end view of a feature's lifecycle from a single dashboard.

    Other tools may treat flags in each environment as more distinct, separate objects, which can sometimes make it harder to trace a single feature's entire journey. 
    The key benefit of the Unleash model is simplified management, clear traceability, and a more intuitive structure for applying environment-specific RBAC.
