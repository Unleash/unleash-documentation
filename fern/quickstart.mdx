In this guide, you'll:

1. **Sign up** for a free, cloud-hosted Unleash Enterprise instance.

2. **Create your first feature flag** using the Unleash Admin UI.

3. **Connect Unleash to your application** by integrating an SDK into your codebase.

If you prefer to manage your own infrastructure, see the [self-hosted setup guide](/using-unleash/deploy/getting-started). To use the open-source version, see the instructions in the [Unleash GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash?tab=readme-ov-file#get-started-with-unleash).

## Sign up for an Unleash Enterprise Cloud trial[​](#sign-up-for-an-unleash-enterprise-cloud-trial "Direct link to Sign up for an Unleash Enterprise Cloud trial")

Start by signing up for a [free 14-day trial](https://www.getunleash.io/plans/enterprise-payg) of Unleash Enterprise Cloud. After you submit the form, you will receive a confirmation email. Follow the link in the email to set your password and log in to your Unleash instance.

## Create your first feature flag[​](#create-your-first-feature-flag "Direct link to Create your first feature flag")

Once you've logged in, it's time to create your first feature flag:

1. In the Unleash Admin UI, open the **Default** project.
2. Click **New feature flag**.
3. Enter a name, and click **Create feature flag**.

For more details on creating feature flags, see [How to create a feature flag](/how-to-create-feature-flag).

## Connect your application to Unleash[​](#connect-your-application-to-unleash "Direct link to Connect your application to Unleash")

Next, use one of the client or backend [SDKs](/reference/sdks) to connect Unleash with your application.

- * Connect a frontend SDK
  * Connect a backend SDK

1. **Create an API token**

   In the Unleash Admin UI, create a [frontend API token](/reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys#frontend-tokens) in **Admin settings > Access control > API access**.

2. **Get your Unleash API URL**

   Find the base URL of your Unleash Cloud instance (for example, `https://us.app.unleash-hosted.com/some-instance-id`). Your frontend API URL is this base URL with `/api/frontend` appended to it.

3. **Initialize the SDK**

   In your application code, initialize the SDK using your API URL and token.

The following example shows how to use the [JavaScript SDK](/reference/sdks/javascript-browser) to connect to your Unleash instance:

JavaScript SDK

```
import { UnleashClient } from "unleash-proxy-client";const unleash = new UnleashClient({    url: "https://<YOUR_UNLEASH_INSTANCE>/api/frontend",    clientKey: "<YOUR_TOKEN>",    appName: "<YOUR_APP_NAME>",});unleash.on("synchronized", () => {    // Unleash is ready to serve updated feature flags.    // Check a feature flag    if (unleash.isEnabled("some-flag")) {        // do cool new things when the flag is enabled    }});
```

1. **Create an API token**

   In the Unleash Admin UI, create a [backend token](/reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys#backend-tokens) in **Admin settings > Access control > API access**.

2. **Get your Unleash API URL**

   Find the base URL of your Unleash Cloud instance (for example, `https://us.app.unleash-hosted.com/some-instance-id`). Your API URL is this base URL with `/api` appended to it.

3. **Initialize the SDK**

   In your application code, initialize the SDK using your API URL and token.

The following example shows how to use the [Node.js SDK](/reference/sdks/node) to connect to your Unleash instance:

Node.js SDK

```
const { initialize } = require("unleash-client");const unleash = initialize({    url: "https://<YOUR_UNLEASH_INSTANCE>/api",    appName: "<YOUR_APP_NAME>",    customHeaders: {        Authorization: "<YOUR_TOKEN>",    },});unleash.on("synchronized", () => {    // Unleash is ready to serve updated feature flags.    if (unleash.isEnabled("some-flag")) {        // do cool new things when the flag is enabled    }});
```
