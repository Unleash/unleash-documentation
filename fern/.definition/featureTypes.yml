      docs: >-
        Updates the lifetime configuration for the specified [feature flag
        type](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/feature-toggles#feature-flag-types).
        The expected lifetime is an integer representing the number of days
        before Unleash marks a feature flag of that type as potentially stale.
        If set to `null` or `0`, then feature flags of that particular type will
        never be marked as potentially stale.


        When a feature flag type's expected lifetime is changed, this will also
        cause any feature flags of this type to be reevaluated for potential
        staleness.

                after the number of days indicated by this property.
