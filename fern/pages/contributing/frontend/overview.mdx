## Frontend overview

The frontend is written in react/typescript. It's a single page application that communicates with the backend via a REST API. The frontend is built using vite and served by the backend.

## ADRs

We have created a set of ADRs to help guide the development of the frontend:

* [Component naming](/contributing/ADRs/front-end/component-naming)
* [Interface naming](/contributing/ADRs/front-end/interface-naming)
* [Preferred component props usage](/contributing/ADRs/front-end/preferred-component-props-usage)
* [Preferred export](/contributing/ADRs/front-end/preferred-export)
* [Preferred function type](/contributing/ADRs/front-end/preferred-function-type)
* [Preferred styling method](/contributing/ADRs/front-end/preferred-styling-method)
* [Preferred data mutation method](/contributing/ADRs/front-end/preferred-data-mutation-method)
* [Preferred data fetching method](/contributing/ADRs/front-end/preferred-data-fetching-method)
* [Preferred folder structure](/contributing/ADRs/front-end/preferred-folder-structure)
* [Preferred form architecture](/contributing/ADRs/front-end/preferred-form-architecture)
* [OpenAPI SDK generator](/contributing/ADRs/front-end/sdk-generator)
