The Client API is designed for [backend SDKs](/sdks/node) and [Unleash Edge](/unleash-edge) to fetch feature flag configurations. This API returns all [feature flags](/concepts/feature-flags) and [activation strategies](/concepts/activation-strategies) for server-side evaluation.

**Base path**: `<your-unleash-url>/api/client`

**Primary use**: Backend services fetch complete flag configurations to evaluate flags server-side with full [activation strategy](/concepts/activation-strategies) logic and [constraints](/concepts/unleash-context).

## Authentication

Use [backend tokens](/concepts/api-tokens-and-client-keys) for authentication. These tokens can be scoped to specific [projects](/concepts/projects) and [environments](/concepts/environments). Backend tokens must remain secret and should never be exposed in client-side code.

To create a backend token, go to **Admin settings > Access control > API access > New API token**

## Available endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/client/features` | GET | Fetch all [feature flags](/concepts/feature-flags) and configurations. |
| `/api/client/features/{featureName}` | GET | Fetch specific feature flag configuration. |
| `/api/client/metrics` | POST | Report flag usage metrics. |
| `/api/client/metrics/custom` | POST | Report [impact metrics](/concepts/impact-metrics). |
| `/api/client/register` | POST | Register SDK instance. |

## Using with Unleash Edge

[Unleash Enterprise Edge](/unleash-edge) uses the Client API to stay synchronized with your Unleash instance. Edge provides:

- Reduced latency for distributed applications.
- Built-in caching and fallback.
- Lower load on your main Unleash instance.
- Frontend API endpoint support.
