The Admin API provides comprehensive programmatic access to all Unleash resources. Use it to manage [feature flags](/concepts/feature-flags), [projects](/concepts/projects), [environments](/concepts/environments), [users and roles](/concepts/rbac), [integrations](/integrate), and more. This API powers the Unleash Admin UI and enables automation workflows.

**Base path**: `<your-unleash-url>/api/admin`

**Primary use**: Create and manage flags, configure projects, control access, integrate with third-party tools, and automate deployment workflows.

## Authentication

Use **[service account tokens](/concepts/service-accounts)** or **personal access tokens** for authentication. Service accounts are preferred for production integrations as they're not tied to individual users.

To create a service account, go to **Admin settings > Service accounts > New service account**.

To create a personal access token, go to **Profile > View profile settings > Personal API tokens > New API token**.

All requests require the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  https://your-unleash-instance.com/api/admin/projects
```

Learn more about [API tokens and client keys](/concepts/api-tokens-and-client-keys).

## API specification

You can also access the OpenAPI specification from your Unleash instance:

- **Interactive Swagger UI**: `<your-unleash-url>/docs/openapi/`
- **Raw JSON**: `<your-unleash-url>/docs/openapi.json`

<Note>
OpenAPI is enabled by default in v5.2+. For v4.13+, set `ENABLE_OAS` environment variable.
