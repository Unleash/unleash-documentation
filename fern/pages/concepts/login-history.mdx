Login history helps you monitor access to your Unleash instance by tracking login events. It records both successful and unsuccessful login attempts. You can use this information to audit user activity within your instance, identify and investigate failed login attempts, or debug issues related to misconfigured authentication providers.

You can find the login history in the Admin UI by navigating to **Admin settings > User config > Login history**.

For each login event, it lists:

 - **Created**: The date and time the login event occurred.
 - **Username**: The username used for the login attempt.
 - **Authentication**: The type of authentication method used (for example, `password`, `open-id-connect`).
 - **IP address**: The IP address from which the login attempt was made.
 - **Success**: Whether the attempt was successful (`True` for successful).
 - **Failure reason**: If a login attempt failed, this provides the reason. To see the failure reason, hover over the `False` label in the **Success** column.

## Data retention

Login history events are kept for 336 hours (14 days). Events older than this retention period are automatically deleted and cannot be recovered. If you need to retain login event information for a longer period, consider periodically [downloading login history](#download-login-history).

## Download login history

To download the login history, go to the login history page and click **Download login history**.
